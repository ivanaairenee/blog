**Don't fear intelligent machines. Work with them. TED Talk by Chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov**

You are probably familiar with the name Garry Kasparov. Or, you're probably more familiar with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" target="_blank">historical match</a>. Garry Kasparov was the chess grandmaster who went against IBM's Deep Blue on classical chess matches on 1996 and 1997. The talk was very inspiring and Garry was such a witty man with witty remarks. My favorite quote from the talk is "Nobody remembers that I won the first match". That, in some way, is very deep but I couldn't help but smile at that remark. Listen on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/id/podcast/tedtalks-audio/id160904630?mt=2&i=1000386002932" target="_blank">Apple Podcast</a> or on <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/garry_kasparov_don_t_fear_intelligent_machines_work_with_them" target="_blank">TED's official website</a>.

**How To Scrape Websites with Python and BeautifulSoup Article by Justin Yek**

I know how handy web scraping is, but unfortunately I can't talk further about how it works etc. I read the article and thought that it explains well what it intends to explain. <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe" target="_blank">Give it a shot!</a>

**Glitch**

Now comes the fun part! I don't think I have to talk any further about this one. Just fucking <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank">go to their website</a>. You're welcome ;)
