**The Future of the Open Internet - and our way of life - is in our hands Article by Quincy Larson**

It is not a new article. It was published back in March and I've stumbled upon it several times already, but I have just gotten the chance to read it fully (it is a long article) yesterday. It is something that you just have to share immediately after reading. It gives me insight to a lot of things I haven't really been exposed to before. <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/inside-the-invisible-war-for-the-open-internet-dd31a29a3f08" target="_blank">Read it on Medium</a>.

**Missive**

<a href="https://missiveapp.com/">Missive</a> is an email app that target teams and provide features like team email management, assignment, and shared labels. It's part email client part trello and part slack, I think. <a href ="http://hn.premii.com/#/article/14564189">Read the author's article on HackerNews</a> that talks about the stacks that they use and <a href="https://missiveapp.com/">visit their official website</a>.
