**Gatsby**

<a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> is a static site generator built in React.js. Everything else can be looked up on its documentation. I fell in love when I first discovered it and fell even deeper after using and developing with it. This blog is built with Gatsby! It is so simple and very easy to use unlike any other React apps I've participated in developing. It's newbie friendly if you're trying to learn React.js. Have a shot at it!


**FrontEnd Happy Hour Podcast**

Easily my favorite podcast channel ever. Usually features 3-4 panelists and 1-2 guests that talk about FrontEnd development and technologies as casually as conversations over drinks. They publish episodes weekly. Listen on Apple Podcast or on <a href="http://frontendhappyhour.com/" target="_blank">their official website</a>

**Last Young Renegade album by All Time Low**

Words alone can't describe how much I love this new album of All Time Low's. *Every* single song is great. I hope you'll like it too! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0gpNGTVNivS2wB32tzV3OH" target="_blank">Listen on Spotify</a>.
