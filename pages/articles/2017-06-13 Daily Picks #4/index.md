**How I Built This with John Zimmer of Lyft Podcast**

John Zimmer is the co-founder of Zimride that eventually became Lyft, one of the biggest ride hailing service in the United States, Uber's tightest competitor. The talk tells the story of him from building the business, leaving Lehman Brothers, tackling the governments, and eventually building toward Lyft's goal to erase the need of owning a vehicle in the United States. The podcast is not brand new, but it was worth my 45 minute trip to work.

**Learn Anything Open Source Project**

I found this one very recently prior to writing today's picks. It is a very resourceful web app to discover structured materials and resources you need to learn things. <a href="http://learn-anything.xyz" target="_blank">visit their website</a>.
