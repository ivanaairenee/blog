**SkyGuru App**

I got this from one of FEHH Podcast's picks to be honest and finds it to be ultra cool. It is a flight app that could provide passengers with interactive advice, real time turbulence forecast, and flight information which all can be accessed through airplane mode. So damn cool. <a href="http://myskyguru.com/" target="_blank">Go checkout their website</a>.

**Front End Dev Bookmarks by Dypsilon**

I found it when browsing through Front End Development mind map on <a href="http://learn-anything.xyz" target="_blank">learn-anything</a> (featured on <a href="/daily-picks-4/">yesterday's picks</a>). It is a very big catalog containing extensive resources for front end developers. <a href="https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks" target="_blank">Visit their github</a>.
