**Pokemon Terminal**

This is a very cute thing I found out (again) from Front End Happy Hour's picks. It is as easy as npm install on mac and linux. But on linux you ought to have Tilix or Terminilogy or basically terminal which you can customize its background. <a href="https://github.com/LazoCoder/Pokemon-Terminal" target="_blank">Check them out!</a>
