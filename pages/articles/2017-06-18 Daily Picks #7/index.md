**I used to think I was awesome. Google fucked that up for me. Article by Jon Westenberg**

I used to think that I was special. In high school I made myself read news, especially the tech section, every single day. It kind of made me obsessed with the tech world and its people. I was awed by the billion dollar acquisitions, and I believed that some day in my university days I would be building a startup with this bunch of other special people, be acquitted by some giant company like google or facebook and be instantly rich.

I feel lucky I have realized that it is not how it works.

This article takes me back to those days when I was obsessed and give me a little kick all over again here and there. <a href="https://medium.com/hi-my-name-is-jon/i-used-to-think-i-was-awesome-google-fucked-that-up-for-me-86e15fae2c86" target="_blank">Read it on Medium</a>
