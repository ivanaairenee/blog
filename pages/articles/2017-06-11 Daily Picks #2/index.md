**mini.css**

<a href="http://minicss.org/" target="_blank">mini.css</a> is a fairly new css framework campaigning to be minimal, responsive, and style agnostic. I personally don't really use css frameworks like bootstrap or foundation because I think that they kind of restrain me and they don't really help me like they do a lot of people that depend upon it. But what makes me interested in this new framework is the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/5-reasons-to-try-out-mini-css-62ddb47b9370" target="_blank">author's article</a> that promised that this framework has extensive documentation compared to others and is easy to customize, AND... it is made out of **css flexbox**. That's it, I don't need a lot of reason to feature it here on picks today. Flexbox is life.

I don't think I need to say anything about this one. Just <a href="https://medium.com/series/dont-try-to-be-first-just-focus-on-being-best-ebb148a840ac?source=userActivityShare-6e3377a7da3a-1497149904" target="_blank">read it</a>, it's good (has to be viewed on medium app tho).
