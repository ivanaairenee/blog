This blog simply features things that I found interesting every day, which I like to call "my daily picks". Mainly inspired by picks at the end of every episode of <a href="http://frontendhappyhour.com/" target="_blank">Front End Happy Hour Podcast</a> which is my favorite section. It just shows how everyone can discover a lot of different interesting things.

This is mainly a space for me to recover my writing habit which I've abandoned a long time ago and building a habit of reading, listening, discovering, and sharing great stuffs. I'm intending it to be a 365-thing, meaning that I will (hopefully) post my picks everyday.

I hope you enjoy my picks and your stay here :)
